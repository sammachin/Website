name: Cable Plugger
description: Plug/Unplug DKs
full_description_md: |
  During the first days of EMF this role involves going round the DKs and plugging in network and power cables, making sure they're safely positioned to avoid people tripping, or damaging our equipment. In the later days you'll be unplugging cables instead.

  You'll need to be reasonably mobile as this role requires a lot of walking around the site.
